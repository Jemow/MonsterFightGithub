# Monster Fight

## Rules

Description : This is a game where we have a fight between 2 mob,
at the beginning, the player has to choose which mob are going to
fight. The mobs which are going to fight must have distinct races,
all the mobs can, deal damage (damage dealt are subtracted by
the opponent's defense point), heal themselves and parry which allows
the mob to enforce his defense points. The fight end only if one
of the mob are dead.

## Races

- **Human** : Humans have really low health, they're good in attack and defence
- **Orc** : They have a good attack but not really effective in defence
- **Ogre** : Maybe the scariest race in here, they have a lot of health
but they're also probably the lowest ones
- **Elf** : Elvs have the worst defence and health but they are really fast
and know how to attack properly

## Competences

- **Attack** : Attack the opponent, bypassing his defense
- **Parry** : Parry allows the user to increase his defense for 2 turns
- **Heal** : Heal the user by a specific amount (cannot heal over the maximum)
